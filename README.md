# MTA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

# Introduction 

a lot of people in New York using The Metropolitan Transportation subways as main 
way for transportation. The MTA says that it is serving a population of 15.3 million 
people across a 5,000-square-mile travel area surrounding New York City through 
Long Island, southeastern New York State, and Connecticut. So it has a huge amount 
of traffic daily. So from that traffic the advertising companies will not miss that so
when you enter any subway station you will notice there are many and huge 
billboards every where in the station.



# Problem

The problem here that these advertisement methods are old and not compatible with
the traffic and what are they interested on. 
So, I will analyze data to investigate if there are some patterns from the visitors to
the MTA stations. To have better billboards and to have compatible advertisements
to the people and to know what the value of the billboard and how many people is
will see it.

# Insights

▪ Found busy days for stations.<br>
▪ Comparison between the Top Stations and bottom stations. and found there is a very large deference. <br>
▪ Have better understand that where is the busiest Control Units.<br>
▪ Have better understand that where is the busiest Units.<br>


# Future work 

I will have better understanding for the people and what method to use for advertising when using analysis based on demographics and geographic data.
